This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About
This was a simple applicatiion developed in Jan 2023. The user inputs a date in the format, and the application displays the associated NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day fpr that date. Images of space are all pulled from the NASA API. Animations are primarily used from the Framer Motion library.

Ideally this project will be split into components to support a loading bar functionality and implement a cleaner design. For future projects, I will split the frontend and backend (because all API data fetching was completed within the React application, which was a bit tricky to manage with several components).
